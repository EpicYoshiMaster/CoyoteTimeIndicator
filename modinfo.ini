description="What the heck is a Coyote Time???[br][br][br]It's a mechanic in plaformers to give you extra leniency to do a full jump when you go off a platform![br][br][br]This mod lets you see visually when this short period of time (0.2 seconds) actually occurs, so you can learn to react to it! This might be handy if you're looking to learn speedrun tricks like the DSJ and TSJ, which rely on this to work. [br][br][br]Config options are included to change when this Indicator is active and what color it uses to represent the countdown![br][br]"
